            a potential employee. I'm always looking forward to learn something new and to combine my personal skill with a group to create something new a different. I believe that 
            I have what it takes to help the company strive.</p>
            
            <p>I am a bit of a quick learner but I like to learn about something in detail. I want to know as much about what the company has to offer and what I can do to help the 
            company and my team if necessary. I have a lot for experience coding in C++, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL Javascript and jQuery. I also have experience in programs such as Visual
            Studios, Netbeans, Oracle, and Brackets as well as using Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel. I don't have a lot of experience within the IT workfield but I have a lot of 
            experience working with a team and I am eager to learn more as time goes on.</p>
            
            <p>I'm always eager to help out a company in any way possible. The experience of working with a well rounded group or being able to provide something that I know will
            help others in the future is what I strive for. I want to work with a group that is looking to make a change and improve on anything in and shape imaginable. I hope that
            I will be able to strive with your company and I hope I will be able to provide what your company is looking for. Thank you for reading my cover letter and I hope to be working with
             you soon.</p>
